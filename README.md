[Play It!](http://vast-falls-04014.herokuapp.com/)

A recreation of the popular Simon Says game built with React primarily using the React Hooks API

## Description

A simon says game replica. Follow and memorize the pattern on screen. When the 
pattern ends, mimic the pattern back to advance to the next level. If you fail to copy the exact pattern, enter your initials to store your high score.

## Instructions

1. Click the start button to begin the game
2. Watch and memorize the pattern
3. When the pattern ends, click the buttons in the correct order to mimic the pattern

## Roadmap

- More uniform, terse styles
- Replace Apollo components with hooks
- Animation for signalling the beginning of watching the pattern, and playing the game
- Better experience playing on mobile
- Game Modes: Remove sounds, increase speed, fire off pattern at different speeds
